# workersearchapp

in this project, I made a worker record search app.
I listed an array of objects
Every worker has a name, an age, a salary and a photo.
When you start to write name of a worker, If letters that you write includes letter of name of worker, App shows you these workers's records.
I wanted to practice in this project to practice javascript array .includes method.
I made it for every object in array.
Thanks for reading.
